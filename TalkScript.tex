I guess we'll get right into it then. Hi everyone, thanks for coming along to my talk today. My name is Amy Stringer and for the past 6 months or so I've been working at the Global Change Institute at the University of Queensland on some big data. I'm going to tell you about that data in just a moment, but before that I'd like to get an idea of how many in the audience have had to deal with big data at some point in their careers, can I get a show of hands, or a some crying sounds if you have?

Okay good, it looks like we have a few, I'd like to find out what everyone is working on once I'm done up here.

While we're on this train, how many of you have data with multiple grouping structures, or subsets that all follow the same general structure? And one last little bit of interaction before I start talking about me, how many of those working with big data need to be able to see the general trends over those grouping structures?

[witty banter about people being in the right place]
