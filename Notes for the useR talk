Notes for the useR talk 

- start out talking about the data 
- go through most things with the GBR dataset 
- build out from image -> transect -> reef -> subregion -> region 
- maybe try and access some of the images from the global reef record and do a zoom ... or take screenshots from the interactive map in leaflet 
- make a new map in leaflet with the different levels on it - this could take some time
